	<h1>OrienRepr Project</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
	  OrienRepr is a formal verification project in Coq, for "Orientation Representation (OR)" problem, which is focused on derivation of popular models or algorithms for OR, including Euler Angles, Rotation Matrices, Axis-Angles, and Unit Quaternion.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Note that, OrienRepr project is part of VFCS (Verified Flight Control System) project, which is not published for now.
	</p>
	<p>
	  This project need FinMatrix library, which is a formal matrix library in Coq, and also developed by us.
	  This library is located in <a href="https://zhengpushi.github.io/projects/FinMatrix/">FinMatrix project</a>.
